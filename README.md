### 1. AI robots on telegram
This is the nlp project modified by the final project of coursera course: advanced machine learning specialization-Natural Language Processing.  
It will be put on the telegram messenger supported by amazon web service (AWS) EC2 server and named wayne-bot (waynewu86Bot). <br>

Basically it will do the simple conversations. <br> 
it will also serve as a stackoverflow assistant where you can ask it about code questions and it will return stackoverflow related links.

### 2. Image captioning
This is the CV-related project modified by the final project of coursera course: advanced machine learning specialization-Introduction to Deep Learning.   

It will caption the given image and return a descriptive sentence that depicts the graph.

### 4. Movie Bot with keras
This is the nlp project completely done by Ting-Wei Wu with data preprocessing and keras seq2seq model establishment. <br>

Training data are extracted from movie_lines.tsv. Detailed descriptions are shown in the jupyter notebook: LHW4-Short-base.ipynb.

### 5. Movie Bot with pytorch
This is the nlp project completely done by Ting-Wei Wu with data preprocessing and pytorch seq2seq model establishment. <br>
It is same with the project Movie-bot-keras except new implementation with pytorch model.

Training data are extracted from movie_lines.tsv. Detailed descriptions are shown in the README.md in the subfolder.

### 6. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for Naruto character generation
This is the deep learning project completely done by Ting-Wei Wu. Basically, it simulated the style drawing from Naruto figures to construct new naruto characters by artificial intelligence. <br>

### 7. Recurrent Neural Network for Taiwanese song's lyrics generation
This is the deep learning project completely done by Ting-Wei Wu. Basically, it will generate some intriguing lyrics based on the major taiwanese songs' style. The networks are based on simple RNN model with major three singers. <br>

### 8. Malaria Cell Prediction
This is the deep learning project with CNN Resnet models from pytorch. Image data are provided via Kaggle dataset: [Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/home). The task is to classify cell images into two categories: parasitized or uninfected.
