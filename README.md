Self Projects to refine and collections

### 1. AI robots on telegram
This is the nlp project modified by the final project of coursera course: advanced machine learning specialization-Natural Language Processing.  
It can be also referred to the following respositories: <br>
1) Coursera-advanced-machine-learning-specialization/ 4.Natural-Language-Processing/ project <br>
2) My-Sample-Projects/ 3.NLP/ project <br>

It will be put on the telegram server and named wayne-bot (waynewu86Bot). <br>
Basically it will do the simple conversations. <br> 
it will also serve as a stackoverflow assistant where you can ask it about code questions and it will return stackoverflow related links.

### 2. Image captioning
This is the CV-related project modified by the final project of coursera course: advanced machine learning specialization-Introduction to Deep Learning.   
It can be also referred to the following respositories: <br>
1) Coursera-advanced-machine-learning-specialization/ 1.Introduction-to-Deep-Learning/ 10. with_pic_week6_final_project_image_captioning_clean.ipynb <br>

It will caption the given image and return a descriptive sentence that depicts the graph.  


### 3. Twitter hashtags
This is the pyspark project that will analyze the most frequent hashtags used by individual users.   
It can be also referred to the following respositories: <br>
1) My-Sample-Projects/ 1.Machine_Learning/ 5.pyspark/ Twitter_hashtags.ipynb <br>
2) My-Sample-Projects/ 3.NLP/ 10.hashtag_bilstm.ipynb <br>

### 4. Movie Bot
This is the nlp project completely done by self with data preprocessing and keras seq2seq model establishment. <br>

Run \<python test.py\> could interact with the bot with simple conversations which could be trained better with more computational sources. <br>

Training data are extracted from movie_lines.tsv. Detailed descriptions are shown in the jupyter notebook: LHW4-Short-base.ipynb.
