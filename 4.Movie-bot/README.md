# 4. Movie Bot with keras
This is the nlp project completely done by Ting-Wei Wu with data preprocessing and keras seq2seq model establishment. <br>

Run `python train.py` to train the model on dataset preferably with gpu. <br>
Run `python test.py` could interact with the bot with simple conversations which could be trained better with more computational sources. <br>

Training data are extracted from movie_lines.tsv. Detailed descriptions are shown in the jupyter notebook: LHW4-Short-base.ipynb.
